The purpose of the CSV project was learn and demonstrate knowledge of matplotlib. 
We progressed from simple plots to multiple subplots with more than one row of data.

The final part of the project was the assignment which brought of the skills together with a little added complexity.
We had to demonstrate our ability to pull data from two different sources to create a subplot on each source while not
directly referencing the index number that corresponded to the column of data needed. We instead had to use the header
row to call the index needed so that our code to form the two plots of the subplot were the same (except for the nuances
that allowed the data to be called and stored for the two different sources).
